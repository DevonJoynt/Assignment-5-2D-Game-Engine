This is the classic game of pong where your opponent is the computer.
Use the paddle to bounce the ball back and forth and trying not to miss hitting the ball.
If you miss, your opponent gets a point. If the computer misses, you get a point.
The ball speeds up with each hit from the paddle to make it more difficult.
